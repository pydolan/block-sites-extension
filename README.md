# block-sites-extension
Chrome Extension for blocking sites. Got starting code from somewhere when this was first wrote, but don't have source to give attribution. Please update if found.  [Fancy Settings 1.2](https://github.com/frankkohlhepp/fancy-settings) used though, which maybe was part of original tutorial
